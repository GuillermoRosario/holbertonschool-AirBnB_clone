# holbertonschool-AirBnB_clone

Holberton School AirBnB Proyect

Description of the project:

In this proyect we wrote a a command interpreter to manage our AirBnB objects.
This is the first step towards building our first full web application: the AirBnB clone. 
What we build during this project will connect with all other following projects: such as HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…

Steps Taken:

Create a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instance

Create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file

Create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel.

Create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.

Create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine
